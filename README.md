## Technical notes
To use **Corporate Ui** do the following:

defineCustomElements()
```
To use **Scania theme** do the following:

addTheme(scania)
```
Add a ignore rule for **Corporate Ui** custom elements and use of Vue router:

Vue.use(VueRouter)
```
We also configured the routers active class and mount the app to the body node
